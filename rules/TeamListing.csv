(and money)","The Reavers were formed almost a century ago, in 2389, when a vacant franchise came up in what was then the Oldlands Conference. Known during their first few years as the Altdorf Acolytes, the team quickly established their reputation for great skill and ability, as original owner DD Griswell Snr poached and bought up the best players throughout the western lands! This policy of marrying awesome buying power with the best money can buy has seen the Reavers in good stead throughout their long life. Today, under DD’s great-grandson JJ Griswell Jr, the Reavers are probably the finest all-round team in the AFC.","2000","9","500000","6","1","3","0","1"

"58","Gouged Eye","4","Data/Gui/Images/Logos/LogoOrcs01.dds","6","Waaagh!","The humans don’t have things all their own way on the Blood Bowl field, and nowhere is this more true than at the Doom Dome, dismal dingy home of The Gouged Eye. Under the auspices of tribal overlord Gobsuck Skullcrush XII and the extremely sadistic training methods of Severlimb, the team have risen from being a laughing stock to chief contenders for top team on the continent. It is unfortunate that the Gouged Eye tend to play in the same leagues as the Reavers, as one side must defeat the other if they are to proceed into the upper reaches of the various cups and championships.","1460","8","0","3","1","3","0","1"
"59","Warhammerers","2","Data/Gui/Images/Logos/LogoDwarfs01.dds","1","Beware - these guys are kerr-ayzee!","Dwarfs have never been best suited to the game of Blood bowl; they are slow and not agile as some of the other races. However, this does not stop the Dwarfs enjoying and playing the game. This is most apparent in the Warhammerers as they may not be the best players on the field but what they lack in ability they more than make up for in their mix of volatile and blatantly illegal weapons.","0","4","250000","4","1","2","3","1"
